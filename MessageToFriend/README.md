Send Message to your friends from Alfred.

### Installation
Grab the extension present in build directory and enjoy. Current Version is 0.1

### Usage
Just type msg and then start typing contact name or email or phone number. As you start typing, matching contacts will appear. Select one of them and then enter the message you want to send. That's it :)

### Features
* Send Gtalk Message/Imessage/SMS to your contacts

### Note
First time, building indexes will take time. From next time, it will be instant

### Special Note
Inspired from my fav extension - IM by NolanChan. But for some reason, he abondoned it. Tried to tinker a bit, but then realized its easier to rewrite. Hence this extension
This is just the first version. Expect many many bugs to appear ;)
